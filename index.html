<h1>Jesus is good</h1>
<p>"Come Home Running"<br/><br/>
Oh heart of mine, why must you stray?<br/>
From one so fair you run away<br/>
And one more time you have to pay<br/>
The heaviness of needless shame<br/>
<br/>
Oh heart of mine, come back home<br/>
You've been too long out on your own<br/>
And He's been there all along<br/>
Watching for you down the road<br/>
<br/>
So come home running<br/>
His arms are open wide<br/>
His name is Jesus<br/>
He understands<br/>
He is the answer<br/>
You are looking for<br/>
So come home running<br/>
Just as you are<br/>
<br/><br/>
Oh child of God so dearly loved<br/>
And ransomed by the Savior's blood<br/>
And called by name, daughter and son<br/>
Wrapped in the robe of righteousness <br/></p>
